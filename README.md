# Codify Technical Interview with Prisma

## Overview

All developer applicants will be asked to complete a technical interview. Our goal in this interview process is not to assess what you already know about full stack development, but you ability to quickly learn and apply new skills and solve technical problems. Before the interviews, we will release a detailed guide on what the interview will ask you to do, and point you towards specific resources you can use to learn the concepts the interview will use. It is expected that you will spend 1-3 hours preparing for the interview using the provided resources or any other resources you find online. During the interview, you may use any online documentation or prepared notes to assist you. We don't care if you forget some syntax and have to google it. The only prohibited resources are any AI code generation tools such as GitHub copilot or ChatGPT. You are not expected to finish all questions in the 30 minute time frame, just do your best to accurately complete as many as you can.
